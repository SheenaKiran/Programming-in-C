// Two persons want to access a file "sample.txt". First person want to read the data from the file. The second person want to read and write the data from and to the
// file simultaneously. Can you help them to do so by writing the corresponding programming codes?


// Person 1: Read-Only Access to File 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    FILE *fp;
    char ch;

    // Open file in read mode
    fp = fopen("example.txt", "r");

    if (fp == NULL) 
    {
        printf("Error: Could not open file for reading.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Contents of the file:\n");

    while ((ch = fgetc(fp)) != EOF) 
    {
        putchar(ch);
    }

    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}

//Person 2: Read and Write Access Simultaneously

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() 
{
    FILE *fp;
    char ch;

    // Open file in read+write mode (r+ does not create file if it doesn't exist)
    fp = fopen("example.txt", "r+");

    if (fp == NULL) 
    {
        printf("Error: Could not open file for reading and writing.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Read content first
    printf("Current contents of the file:\n");
    while ((ch = fgetc(fp)) != EOF)
    {
        putchar(ch);
    }

    // Move cursor to end for appending data
    fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);

    // Write data to file
    fprintf(fp, "\nNew line added by Person 2.");

    printf("\nData has been written to the file.\n");

    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
