Identify the storage class in the below code?
#include<stdio.h>
int a;
int main()
{
printf("a=%d",a);
return 0;
}

Answer:
'a' is declared outside any function, including main.
This makes it a global variable.
The default storage class for a global variable is extern.
So, a has the extern storage class.
