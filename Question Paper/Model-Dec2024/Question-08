While using the statement, fp = fopen( "myfile.c", "r" ) ; what happens if,
− ‘myfile.c’ does not exist on the disk
− ‘myfile.c’ exists on the disk

Answer:
a) If data.txt does NOT exist on the disk:
• A new file named data.txt is created.
• The file is opened in write mode.
• The file pointer fp now points to this new, empty file.
• You can now write data to it.
• If file creation fails (e.g., due to permissions), fp will be NULL.
(b) If data.txt already EXISTS on the disk:
• The existing file will be truncated (erased) to zero length.
• All the previous contents are deleted.
• The file is effectively cleared, and you start with a blank file.
• The file pointer fp will point to the beginning of the empty file.
