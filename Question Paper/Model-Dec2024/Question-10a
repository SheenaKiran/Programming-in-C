Write a C program that reads employee's ID, name, status (‘F’ for full-time and ‘P’
for part-time) and basic pay. DA and HRA for full-time employees are 75% and
10% of basic pay respectively. Part-time employees have basic pay only. Print the
total salary of the employee.

Answer:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int empID;
    char name[50];
    char status;
    float basicPay, da = 0, hra = 0, totalSalary;

    // Read input
    printf("Enter Employee ID: ");
    scanf("%d", &empID);

    printf("Enter Employee Name: ");
    scanf(" %s", name);  
    printf("Enter Status (F for Full-time, P for Part-time): ");
    scanf(" %c", &status);

    printf("Enter Basic Pay: ");
    scanf("%f", &basicPay);

    // Calculate salary based on status
    if (status == 'F' || status == 'f') 
    {
        da = 0.75 * basicPay;   // 75% of basic pay
        hra = 0.10 * basicPay;  // 10% of basic pay
    }
    
    totalSalary = basicPay + da + hra;

    // Display result
    printf("\n--- Employee Salary Details ---\n");
    printf("Employee ID     : %d\n", empID);
    printf("Employee Name   : %s\n", name);
    printf("Employee Status : %s\n", (status == 'F' || status == 'f') ? "Full-time" : "Part-time");
    printf("Total Salary    : %.2f\n", totalSalary);

    return 0;
}

output
Enter Employee ID: 1
Enter Employee Name: Raju
Enter Status (F for Full-time, P for Part-time): F
Enter Basic Pay: 2000

--- Employee Salary Details ---
Employee ID     : 1
Employee Name   : Raju
Employee Status : Full-time
Total Salary    : 3700.00
