Answer:

9marks	-	 Invalid	
Identifiers cannot begin with a digit. They must begin with a letter (A–Z, a–z) or an underscore (_).

Mark 2020		
Identifiers cannot contain spaces. Mark 2020 has a space between Mark and 2020, which is not allowed.

v4vote – Valid
 Begins with a letter (v) and contains only alphanumeric characters (v, 4, v, o, t, e), which is allowed.
		
_csdept – Valid
Identifiers can begin with an underscore. _csdept uses valid characters and follows the naming rules.

@cse - Invalid	
Identifiers cannot contain special characters like @. Only letters, digits, and underscores are allowed.

AxB -   Valid 	
This contains only alphabetic characters (A, x, B), and starts with a letter. No rules are violated.
