string processing?Storing and Processing a List of Strings in a Two-Dimensional Array

Answer:

A list of strings can be stored using a 2D character array, where:
-	Each row represents a string
-	Each column represents a character of that string
char names[3][20] = { "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
This defines an array to store 3 strings, each with up to 19 characters (+1 for null terminator \0). Memory layout: 3 rows × 20 columns.
Accessing and Processing Individual Strings
You can process each string using loops:
Example – Print Each String:
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
 {
    printf("%s\n", names[i]);
}
Example – Print Characters of First String:
for (int j = 0; j < strlen(names[0]); j++)
 {
    printf("%c ", names[0][j]);
}
Common Library Functions for String Processing (in <string.h>)
strlen(str)	-	Returns length of string (excluding \0)
strcpy(dest, src)	-	Copies one string to another
strcat(dest, src)	-	Appends one string to another
strcmp(s1, s2)	-	Compares two strings
