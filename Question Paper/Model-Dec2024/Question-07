Suppose a function receives a pointer as an argument. Explain how the function prototype is written. In particular, explain how the data type of the pointer argument
is represented

Answer:

Function Prototype with Pointer Argument in C
When a function receives a pointer as an argument, its prototype must clearly state the data type the pointer points to,
followed by an asterisk * to indicate that it's a pointer.

Syntax:  return_type function_name(data_type *pointer_name);
   data_type → type of data the pointer points to (int, float, char, etc.)
   pointer_name → denotes that the parameter is a pointer

Example 1: Pointer to int
     void update(int *ptr);
  ptr is a pointer to an int
  This means the function can modify the original integer value in the caller's memory
