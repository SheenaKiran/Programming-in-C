What will be the output of the following C program. Justify your answer.
void main() {
  int i=1234, j=0;
  while(i>0) {
    i/=10; j++;
  }
printf("%d %d",i,j) }


Step-by-Step Execution:

Initial values:
i = 1234, j = 0

Loop (while(i > 0)):
  1st iteration: i = 1234 / 10 = 123, j = 1
  2nd iteration: i = 123 / 10 = 12, j = 2
  3rd iteration: i = 12 / 10 = 1, j = 3
  4th iteration: i = 1 / 10 = 0, j = 4
Loop ends (i = 0)
Now, i = 0, j = 4
Output of the program : i = 0, j = 4
