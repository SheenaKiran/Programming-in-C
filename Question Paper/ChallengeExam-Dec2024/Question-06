What will be the output of the following C function, if the function was called 5 times in the main program? Justify your answer.
void fun() {
static int count = 0;
count++;
printf("Count: %d\n", count); }

Answer:

The variable count is declared as static:
It retains its value between function calls.
It is initialized only once, when the function is first called.
On each call to fun():
The value of count increases by 1.
The updated value is printed.

Step-by-step process
Function Call	    count Value
  1st call	           1
  2nd call	           2
  3rd call	           3
  4th call	           4
  5th call	           5
