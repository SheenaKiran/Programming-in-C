What happens in the following scenarios when using the statement 
fp = fopen("data.txt", "w");?
If data.txt does not exist on the disk.
If data.txt already exists on the disk.

Answer:
If data.txt does NOT exist on the disk:
       A new file named data.txt is created.
       The file is opened in write mode.
       The file pointer fp now points to this new, empty file.
       You can now write data to it.
       If file creation fails (e.g., due to permissions), fp will be NULL.
   
If data.txt already EXISTS on the disk:
      The existing file will be truncated (erased) to zero length.
      All the previous contents are deleted.
      The file is effectively cleared, and you start with a blank file.
      The file pointer fp will point to the beginning of the empty file.
