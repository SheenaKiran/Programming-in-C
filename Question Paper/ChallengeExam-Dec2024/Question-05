Compare the difference between structure and union data types in C.

Answer:
             Structure                                                          Union
1. Declared using struct keyword                               1. Declared using union keyword
2. All data members in structure are active at time            2. Only one data member is active at a time
3. Each member within a structure is assigned                  3. All members within a union share the same
   its own unique storage area                                    storage area within the computer's memory.
                                                                  Union help to save memory
4. Total size of structure = size of all the                   4. Total size of structure = size of the largest member
   members in the structure                                       in the union
5. Members can be accessed at any time                         5. Members can be accessed soon after its
                                                                  value is stored(assigned). (Only the value
                                                                  of member last stored is found in the storage.
                                                                  (i.e.only one value can be stored in a
                                                                   union at a time))
6. It is useful to declare a compound data type                6. It is useful in certain cases where the user will
   to group data members related to a person                      select any one data member in the group of
   or item.                                                        data members.            
7. It is commonly used in most of the applications             7. It is not commonly used.
